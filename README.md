# pacmen factory activity

Activity which creates pacmen one by one at a random location on the page and then starts them moving in their respective direction until they collide with the window border at which point they reverse direction and continue.

To run activity, click "AddPacMan" to add 'pacmen' to the page until there are enough, then click the "Start Game" button to start the pacmen moving around the window.

Future improvements would be adding an counter to the 'pacmen' that changes the color or expires a pacman after a certain amount of collisions with the window
